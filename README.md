# Growth-Infrastructure-Automation
This project focused on building a scalable analytics pipeline. I integrated customer and transaction data using Python, applied data quality checks to ensure reliability, and created KPI tables that feed Power BI dashboards. The goal was to eliminate manual reporting and provide stakeholders with trusted, up-to-date performance insights
